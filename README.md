# Overview

SpeculationControl is a PowerShell script that summarizes the state of configurable Windows mitigations for various [speculative execution side channel vulnerabilities](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2018/03/15/mitigating-speculative-execution-side-channel-hardware-vulnerabilities/), such as CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre variant 2) and CVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown).

For an explanation on how to interpret the output of this tool, please see [Understanding Get-SpeculationControlSettings PowerShell script output](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4074629/understanding-the-output-of-get-speculationcontrolsettings-powershell).

# Usage

The released version of this script is maintained through the [SpeculationControl](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SpeculationControl) module on PowerShell Gallery.

To install the released version via PowerShell Gallery:

```
PS C:\> Install-Module -Name SpeculationControl
```

To query the state of configurable mitigations:

```
PS> # Save the current execution policy so it can be reset
PS> $SaveExecutionPolicy = Get-ExecutionPolicy
PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Currentuser
PS> Import-Module SpeculationControl
PS> Get-SpeculationControlSettings
PS> # Reset the execution policy to the original state
PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy $SaveExecutionPolicy -Scope Currentuser
```

The following provides an example usage and output for this tool.

```
PS C:\> Import-Module SpeculationControl
PS C:\> Get-SpeculationControlSettings
